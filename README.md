*REACT set up the foundation for this application and made it faster as it created
a virtual DOM which only changed components that were mounted or updated.

*Knowing JAVASCRIPT and all the different data types helped me manipulate
data to control my REACT application.

*Proficiency in JAVASCRIPT, REACT, HTML, and CSS made • writing JSX easy.
Learning new technology is exciting so I learned how to use Google Materials-
UI on my own and integrated it into different components of my REACT
application together with classic CSS.

*Using MATERIALS-UI on my REACT app taught me how to apply CSS in JS and
inline styling.

*REDUX made state management quicker and I used it with LOCAL STORAGE for
added functionality. User login is stored in EXPRESS-SESSIONS as well.

*Functions to add products, update them, or removing them from the cart
involved manipulating data in REDUX, LOCAL STORAGE and REACT components
using my JAVASCRIPT skills.

*Built the server with NODE JS, EXPRESS-SESSIONS and EXPRESS with different
endpoints to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data from my POSTGRES
database with the help of MASSIVE.

*Saving information was made easy using my own POSTGRES database which
involved a users table, a products table, and an orders table. I created and
tested database queries using SQL with the help of SQL Tabs.

*Authorization is handled with Auth0 which allow clients to Log In with
Facebook, Google, or Github. Clients may also choose to sign up with their email
and password which are encrypted and saved by Auth0. In order to do this
I used NODE JS and EXPRESS.

*In order to have payment capability, I added STRIPE and AUTH0 which involved
reading and applying all their REST APIs endpoints and instructions.

*In my REACT app there is an administrator’s dashboard, I created a form to add
a new product to my products database. This form allows the admin to upload
a product image using CLOUDINARY for their reliable photo hosting.

*Upon order confirmation, clients receive a custom e-mail from my REACT ecommerce
website.

* AXIOS calls and promises in my REACT app are handled ASYNCHRONOUSLY to
create a smooth flow of USER EXPERIENCE as they purchase products from my
REACT website.
